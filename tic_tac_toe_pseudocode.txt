Bulletpoints of the games in steps:
1. Initialize an empty board
2. Initialize the first player
3. Initialize the second player
4. Use specifically a while loop since we don't know how many iterations we are going to have
5. Initialize the loop (start the game)
6. Draw a board
7. Ask a player to make a move (choose a field)
8. Check the field (empty or not)
9. If the field is empty, then we put the symbol of the player into the field
10. Check if player wins
11. End game
12. Output: "player wins"
13. Check if draw
14. Ouput: "it is a draw"
15. Switch to another player
16. If the field is occupied, output: "choose a different field"



Tic Tac Toe Pseudocode
STORE empty board
STORE first player
STORE second player
WHILE playing game true 
    OUTPUT board
    INPUT first player's move
    STORE chosen field
    IF chosen field NOT occupied THEN 
        STORE first player symbol into the chosen field
        IF first player wins THEN
            OUTPUT board
            OUTPUT player wins
            BREAK endgame
        ELSE 
            OUTPUT draw
            OUTPUT it is a draw
            BREAK endgame
        switch to the second player
    ELSE
        OUTPUT choose a different field
